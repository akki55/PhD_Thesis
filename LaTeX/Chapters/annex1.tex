\chapter{Case study: Pheasant}
\label{ann:Pheasant}

In this Annex we include the article \cite{Barisic2012plateu} about cases study evaluation of the \gls{dsl} named \gls{pheasant} (Physicist's Easy Analysis Tool), named \textbf{'Quality in use of domain-specific languages: a case study'}, which was published in Proceedings of the 3rd \gls{acm} SIGPLAN workshop on Evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools (PLATEAU) at SPLASH in 2011. A detailed description of \gls{pheasant} can be found in \cite{Amaral2005Thesis}. 

This case study, discussed in Section \ref{sec:Pheasant}, was used as a first usability evaluation example during problem investigation phase of our research process (Figure \ref{fig:research}). Further, it served as illustration example for patterns (Appendix \ref{app:patterns}) of pattern language which instantiate our first solution design (Section \ref{sec:iterativeUCD}). 

This work was funded by PEst-OE/EEI/UI0527/2011 Centro de Informatica e Tecnologias da Informacao (CITI/FCT/UNL).
