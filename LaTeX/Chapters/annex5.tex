\chapter{Case study: DSE Merge}
\label{ann:DSEMerge}

In this Annex we include the article \cite{barisic2016stsm}, named \textbf{'STSM Report: Evaluating the efficiency in use of search-based automated model merge technique'}, which was published in \gls{cost} Action IC1404 \gls{mpm4cps} in 2016.

We evaluated the tool support developed within this project at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, named DSE Merge (Section \ref{sec:DSEMerge}), which presents a novel search-based automated model merge \cite{kessentini2013search}.
Main contribution was illustration of our experiment design proposed in Section \ref{sec:experiment} as a part of our research process (Figure \ref{fig:research}). We showed that design can be easily repeated and reused.
Final report of this project can be downloaded from public repository \footnote{goo.gl/Kq3R1G (accessed September 19, 2017)}.

This work was supported by \gls{cost} Action IC1404 \gls{mpm4cps}.
